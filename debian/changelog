scap (3.2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Tyler Cipriani ]
  * Fix tab completion
    Tab completeion now works like git, i.e., it puts a space after the
    command but not after a completed directory name. Tab completion was
    slowing down deployers as it put an extra space after EVERYTHING.
    (Closes: T144244)
  * Make directories as euid
    Previously directories were being made as ruid. This was causing breakage
    as we move towards using config deployment (\o/) for Mathoid
    (Closes: T145194)

  [ Mukunda Modell ]
  * Add a better user prompting functionscap.utils.confirm
    needed as utils.ask proved to be a bit inflexible.
  * Look for plugins in user home directory.
    Find and load plugins from both ./scap/plugins and ~/.scap/plugins.

  [ Marko Obrovac ]
  * Docs: Introduce config_deploy and erb_syntax
    When doing config deploys, one needs to specify config_deploy in
    scap.cfg. Likewise, Scap3 has the neat feature where one can use the ERB
    syntax in templates, which eases the transition from Puppet.

  * Improve rsync behavior between masters/proxies/targets
    This should save like 8-9 useless rsync's during the sync-apaches stage
    and moves the co-master rsync (currently 1) to a more appropriate place
