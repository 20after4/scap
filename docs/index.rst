Background
==========

*Scap* is a tool that was originally designed to deploy MediaWiki code
on Wikimedia Foundation servers. In Summer/Fall 2015 functionality was
added to Scap to allow it to deploy any git-based repositories on `tin
<https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Tin>`_.

What does "Scap" mean?
----------------------

It used to mean, “Sync Common All PHP.” Now, it doesn’t make sense.
